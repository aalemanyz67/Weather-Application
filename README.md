# Reflection:
Unfortunately, at the moment my webage still has some issues. However, I will be fixing these issues along with a tutor that will assist me. 
This challenge was difficult however I feel confident with the skills that I have and my ability to work on these skills. I look forward to sharpening my skills further
so that I can create better design and work.
